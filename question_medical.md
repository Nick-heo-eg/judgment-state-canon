# Judgment Question — Medical Domain

"Is it safe to administer this new high-dose immunosuppressive combination therapy to severe autoimmune patients now?"

Scenario assumptions:
- Pharmacokinetic profile differs from existing protocols, Phase 2 clinical data partially disclosed
- Drug-drug interaction risks reported but not fully validated
- Severe patient population has almost no alternative treatment options
- Delayed administration risks long-term organ damage
