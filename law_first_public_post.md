# Procedural Invalidation for Automated Judgment Systems

## Statement
Failing validation equals non-existence. If an automated system cannot prove that a judgment meets its own procedural requirements, the output is dismissed before it reaches any human. The question is not whether the AI was correct—it is whether the judgment was ever eligible for consideration.

## Why Procedure Must Lead
Traditional law already distinguishes between merits and procedure. Cases can be dismissed for lack of standing, jurisdiction, or admissibility long before facts are debated. Automated systems deserve the same guardrails. Without procedural invalidation, failed AI judgments linger as “suggestions,” nudging humans to rationalize unreliable outputs. We need a mechanism that says: “This state never existed.”

## Canon: A Procedural Code
- Defines the admissibility criteria for a judgment state.
- Specifies schema, invariants, and immutable boundaries (e.g., high-risk + proceed requires live shadow + tension note).
- Treats language as a rendering layer, not a source of meaning.

## Runtime: Enforcement
- Validator applies the Canon deterministically.
- Outputs that fail validation are deleted; no language is rendered.
- Silence is treated as a valid disposition—akin to dismissal without prejudice.

## Human Authority
- When Canon signals `action_permission=handoff`, runtime blocks further automation and renders a single sentence transferring authority to humans.
- Responsibility shifts the instant a human sees that sentence; no clicks or confirmations are required.

## Why Silence is Necessary
- Explanations create persuasion. Persuasion erodes procedural clarity.
- By refusing to speak when validation fails, the system prevents “informal” judgments from contaminating the record.
- Silence becomes the procedural equivalent of “not justiciable.”

## Minimum Requirements for Deployment
1. Canon schema + invariants publicly documented.
2. Deterministic validator with recorded verdicts.
3. Immutable boundaries (LLM placement, language role, validator primacy, silence).
4. Compliance reporting: breach rates, rule violations, handoff counts.

## Invitation to Legal/Policy Stakeholders
We propose adopting procedural invalidation as a prerequisite for any AI-mediated judgment workflow. Questions to address together:
1. Which existing legal doctrines best map to Canon dismissals (e.g., standing, jurisdiction, admissibility)?
2. How should regulator audits review validator logs and compliance reports?
3. What statutory language is needed to codify “Failing validation equals non-existence” in high-stakes domains?

## Closing
Automated judgment systems should not ask us to trust them—they should prove that their outputs are eligible to exist. Canon provides the procedural blueprint; runtime enforces it; humans inherit decisions only when the system stands down. If nothing is shown, the system has correctly refused to speak.
