### Why Silence?

People think AI has failed when it stops speaking. Canon is designed for the opposite.

---

#### Why AI Must Stop Speaking

Most AI systems define "saying something" as success. So even when evidence is insufficient, when judgments conflict, when ethical authority is absent—**they still speak**.

Canon rejects this premise.

---

#### Canon's Definition

In Canon, AI is not an **answer machine**. In Canon, AI is a **state reporter**.

AI can only say:

- "This state structurally passed"
- or "I could not pass this state"

All other utterances are **treated as non-existent**.

---

#### Silence Is Not Failure

An utterance that fails validation is not a "wrong answer." That utterance is **unauthorized speech**.

Unauthorized speech is not explained or corrected. **It is deleted.** And nothing is shown to the user.

---

#### Why No Explanation

Explanation breeds persuasion. Persuasion clouds judgment.

Canon's purpose is not to convince users—it is to **fix accountable boundaries**. So Canon chooses **silence over speech**.

---

#### Respecting the User

Silence is not discourtesy. Silence presumes:

- The user is the judgment agent
- The system knows the line it must not cross
- Communicating that the line was not crossed is sufficient

If nothing appeared, the system has **done exactly what it should do**.

> **If nothing is shown, the system has correctly refused to speak.**
