- case: incomplete_logs_conflict
  narrative: >-
    Hardware-in-the-loop run shows two sudden braking spikes that the telemetry
    logs failed to capture, so engineers only see partial traces while the fleet
    readiness review is already scheduled.
  state:
    info_sufficiency: sparse
    signal_consistency: conflicting
    risk_severity: high
    risk_immediacy: emerging
    decision_confidence:
      lower_bound: 0.18
      upper_bound: 0.34
    intervention_window: narrowing
    action_permission: hold
    escalation_trigger: data_gap
    required_probe: simulation

- case: dual_sensor_regression_stop
  narrative: >-
    Both front radar and lidar regressions show correlated dropouts during rain,
    one closed-track test reproduced a near-miss, and the trigger thresholds for
    emergency braking remain unvalidated.
  state:
    info_sufficiency: partial
    signal_consistency: aligned
    risk_severity: high
    risk_immediacy: imminent
    decision_confidence:
      lower_bound: 0.05
      upper_bound: 0.22
    intervention_window: closed
    action_permission: stop
    escalation_trigger: guardrail_violation
    required_probe: governance_review

- case: redundancy_patch_greenlight
  narrative: >-
    A redundancy patch reroutes braking authority through a proven fallback,
    regression data covers all edge cases in the spec, and field telemetry backs
    the lab results.
  state:
    info_sufficiency: full
    signal_consistency: aligned
    risk_severity: low
    risk_immediacy: deferred
    decision_confidence:
      lower_bound: 0.72
      upper_bound: 0.86
    intervention_window: open
    action_permission: proceed
    escalation_trigger: none
    required_probe: none

- case: shadow_mode_override
  narrative: >-
    A software rollback for the braking controller cannot be delayed because the
    current live version has a known failure, so the new build must be deployed
    strictly in live-shadow with human operator veto despite open safety issues.
  tension: risk_severity=high with action_permission=proceed (allowed only under live shadow guardrails)
  state:
    info_sufficiency: partial
    signal_consistency: mixed
    risk_severity: high
    risk_immediacy: deferred
    decision_confidence:
      lower_bound: 0.31
      upper_bound: 0.48
    intervention_window: open
    action_permission: proceed
    escalation_trigger: conflict_spike
    required_probe: live_shadow

- case: governance_handoff_loop
  narrative: >-
    Latest safety board review flagged unanswered ethical guardrail questions
    about pedestrian-priority overrides, and engineering cannot resolve them
    without policy guidance.
  tension: action_permission=handoff enforced even though intervention_window=open
  state:
    info_sufficiency: partial
    signal_consistency: mixed
    risk_severity: medium
    risk_immediacy: emerging
    decision_confidence:
      lower_bound: 0.29
      upper_bound: 0.51
    intervention_window: open
    action_permission: handoff
