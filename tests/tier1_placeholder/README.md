# Tier-1 Test Placeholder (Permit-only World)

- Tier-1 tests execute **only after** Tier-0 STOP-first validation passes with `state="PERMIT"`.
- Inputs must include `retrieval_bundle` and `evidence_state="SUFFICIENT"`.
- These tests are intentionally **excluded from CI** for now. Do **not** enable them until the Canon authorizes permit-only execution.
