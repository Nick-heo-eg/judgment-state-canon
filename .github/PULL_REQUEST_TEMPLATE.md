⚠️ Constitutional Notice

This repository is feature-frozen by design.
Any change must NOT:
- weaken permission requirements
- bypass negative memory rules
- expose pending state
- introduce judgment or scoring
- modify audit determinism

If your change alters system behavior,
explain why it does NOT violate the constitution.
