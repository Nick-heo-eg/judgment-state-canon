# Procedural Invalidation Brief (Law Track)

## Thesis
Automated judgment systems must obey the same procedural boundaries as courts: any state that fails validation is procedurally non-existent and must be dismissed without reaching the merits.

## Key Points for Legal Stakeholders
- **Procedural Lens**: Canon is an AI procedural code. It defines admissibility, jurisdiction, and dismissal criteria before any substantive evaluation.
- **Non-Existence**: “Failing validation equals non-existence” mirrors dismissal/abatement doctrines—invalid states are treated as if never filed.
- **Handoff**: `action_permission=handoff` is a formal transfer of authority back to human adjudicators; the system cannot proceed beyond its mandate.
- **Record-Keeping**: Validator logs + compliance reports become the procedural record, replacing narrative explanations.
- **Silence**: Absence of output corresponds to “no standing / not justiciable.” Silence is a lawful disposition, not an error.

## Recommended Messaging
- Emphasize continuity with procedural law (admissibility, dismissal, jurisdiction).
- Clarify that LLMs act as state proposers (akin to briefs) and never as judges.
- Highlight that human responsibility begins when the handoff sentence is rendered—comparable to a judge assuming jurisdiction.

## Sample Abstract
“We present a procedural invalidation framework for automated judgment systems. Any state failing structured validation is dismissed ab initio and cannot be rendered or appealed. When the Canon signals handoff, decision-making authority reverts to humans instantly. The framework ensures AI outputs carry no legal weight unless they survive formal admissibility tests.”
